    let num   = 100
    let num2  = num
    num = 200
    console.log( num, num2 )

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // const players2 = players
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // console.log( players2, players )

    // players2[0] = 'Dog'


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const players3 = players.slice()
    console.log( players )
    players3[3] = 'Bad Dog'
    console.log( players3 )
    // one way
    const players4 = [].concat( players )
    console.log( players4 )
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players]
    console.log(players5)

    const players6 = Array.from( players )
    console.log( players6 )
    const players7 = new Array( players )[0]
    players7[3] = 'Casablancas'
    console.log( players7 )

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const bob = person
    // console.log( bob)
    // bob.age = 99
    // console.log( bob)
    const dev = Object.assign({}, person, {
      age: 99
     })
     console.log( dev )
     console.log(person)

    // and think we make a copy:
     const dev2 = {
       name: 'Jhon',
       age: 25,
       social: {
         twitter: '@jhon'
       }
     }
     const dev3 = Object.assign({}, dev2 )
    //  console.log( dev3 )
    //  console.log( dev2 )
    //  dev3.facebook = 'JhonFace'
    //  console.log( dev3 )
     const dev4 = JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( dev2 ) )
     console.log(dev4)
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //  const devSpread = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
